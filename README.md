# React_Projects
This repository is a collection of various projects and exercises created as I embark on my journey to learn and master the React framework.

## :dart: Objective
Explore and implement core React concepts through practical projects, facilitating a deeper understanding and proficiency in using the React framework.

## :information_source: About
React is a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. This repository serves as a learning journal where I explore and implement React's core concepts and features, including:
- **Components**: Building reusable and maintainable UI components.
- **State and Props**: Managing and passing data within the application.
- **Hooks**: Using React's powerful hooks like **<i>'useState'</i>**, **<i>'useEffect'</i>**, and custom hooks to manage state and side effects.
- **Routing**: Implementing navigation and dynamic routing using **<i>'react-router-dom'</i>**.
- **Context API**: Managing global state and context for better state management.
